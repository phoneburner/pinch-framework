## Sessions

### CSRF Protection

Every session has a CSRF token that is used to protect against CSRF attacks.
The CSRF token is stored in the session and is automatically included in all
forms that are generated by the framework. The CSRF token is also included in
the `X-CSRF-Token` header for AJAX requests.

The following are checked for the CSRF token:

- POST requests bodies with a `_token` field
- The `X-CSRF-Token` header for AJAX requests
- The `X-XSRF-Token` header for AJAX requests (for compatibility with Axios)
